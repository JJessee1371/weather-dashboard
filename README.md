## Description
This application makes use of the OpenWeather API and given an input of a city name 
will provide the user with information on the current weather conditions along with a 5 day 
forecast to include temperature, wind speed, and UV index. A search history function has been included by utilizing local storage to track
the users' interactions with the page. This page was constructed using the Spectre CSS framework.

## Future Development
In the future I would like to make this application more accurate with the data that is returned when the user searches a location. 
Using the current endpoint from OpenWeather the data is retreived by using a city name, however, this becomes a problem since many cities
share the same name. Additionally, I would like to alter the search history to appear as a dropdown when hovering over the search
bar so that it does not consume space on the page especially for smaller mobile devices. Finally, I would like to include the necessary 
material to convert this application into a PWA so that it can be downloaded to the users device and be more readily accessible.
