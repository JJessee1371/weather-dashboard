# weather-dashboard

This application makes use of the Open Weather API and given an input of a city name 
will provide the user with information on the current weather along with a 5 day 
forecast. A secondary goal was to achieve better user interactivity by providing 
a search history that the user can use to get weather information from previous
searches along with ensuring a responsive design that allows for user on any device.
